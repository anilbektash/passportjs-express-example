passportjs-express-example
==========================

Passportjs basic working example using Twitter oauth as I felt the documentation at http://passportjs.org/ was too scattered to be able to easily hit the ground running.

Running the app with your credentials
-------------------------------------
    git clone https://github.com/kulor/passportjs-express-example.git
    cd passportjs-express-example
    npm install
